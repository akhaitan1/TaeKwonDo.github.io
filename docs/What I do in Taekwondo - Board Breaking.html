        <p dir="ltr">In Taekwondo, you will have to break rebreakable boards in order to show your power and accuracy. For each belt test, you will have to break one or more boards with the foot and/or hand techniques that you are being tested on.&nbsp;</p>
        <br />
        <p dir="ltr">The thickness of the board depends on how old you are. Each board colour has a different thickness and the thickness increases in the same order as the colour of belts. For example, the yellow board will be thicker than the white board.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">The white board is for 5 year olds and younger, the yellow board if for 6 to 8 year old, orange board for 9 and 10 year olds, green board for 11 to 13 year olds, blue board for 14+ for girls and for boys 14 year olds and finally the brown board is for 15+ for boys. There is also a black board that is used in competitions. If two or more people break the black board in a competition, they will have to do double boards. For example, the black board and yellow board on top of each other.</p>
        <br />
        <p dir="ltr">The strongest technique to break a board is using a sidekick but only when it is done well.</p>
