        <p dir="ltr">Sparring is using techniques learned in lessons and using them to fight against a partner.&nbsp;</p>
      </strong><strong id="docs-internal-guid-eecb1d0f-7fff-e1bb-2fd4-b61f2159fb"> <br />
      <p dir="ltr">You usually learn sparring when you are a green belt and you are required to do at least two rounds (each two minutes long) at green and blue belt, three rounds at brown and four rounds at red belt and above in order to move up to the next belt.&nbsp;</p>
      <br />
      <p dir="ltr">There are two types of sparring: testing sparring (sparring that you do in the exam to go up to the next belt) and competition sparring.&nbsp;</p>
      <br />
      <p dir="ltr">Testing sparring requires you to do a variety of techniques on a variety of different target areas as well as letting the other person attack you&nbsp; so you can show your blocking skills. The higher belt is also required to go first as a sign of respect. If you are the same belt, then the older person attacks first.</p>
      <br />
      <p dir="ltr">In competition sparring, the aim is to gain the most points by hitting the other person on the target areas. Each round ends in two minutes (this is the more common one) or by one person gaining 7 points. The amount of points you gain depends on the technique used to hit the person. A hand technique (eg. a punch) anywhere on the target area is 1 point. A standing kick (one foot on the floor) on the abdominal region / on the sides of the body gives you 1 point. A jump kick to the abdominal region / on the sides of the body or a standing kick to the head give you 2 points. A jump kick to the head gives you 3 points and is the maximum amount of points you can get with one technique.&nbsp;</p>
      <br />
      <p dir="ltr">There are also penalties in competition sparring. The most common one is given when hitting a person in an area that is not the head or abdominal region / on the sides of the body.&nbsp; You get one warning and then, if it happens again, a point is given to the opponent.</p>
      <br />
      <p dir="ltr">Sparring provides a unique, controlled environment for you and your sparring partner to practice your skills on each other. Sparring is used to teach you how to deal with a live and moving human opponent (versus a static kicking dummy) in a controlled environment with protective sparring gear (i.e. helmet and arm protectors,) and a referee. It also helps build your confidence as you know that if you need to, you know how to protect yourself if you are in a bad situation.</p>
